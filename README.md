# natours-sass-project
This is quite a big project using Sass. Design is not mine (credits to Jonas Schmedtmann), took it from udemy course. 
Has simple npm tools for build process. This project has something to show regarding simple responsive design.
And, of course, very good Sass features. Feel free to clone and play.
Don't forget to say thanks to Jonas!
